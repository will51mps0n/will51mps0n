# Hello â€” I'm Adam Simpson

I'm a C++ and systems programming enthusiast who recently graduated from Computer Science at the University of Michigan (Class of 2025). My work spans:

- Operating systems: paging, file systems, threading libraries
- Systems-level C++: concurrency, synchronization, TCP servers
- Machine learning: data pipelines, PyTorch models, search algorithms
- Full-stack projects: end-to-end MVPs, backend integrations

I'm currently interested in roles and projects in:
- **Systems Software**
- **Kernel / OS Development**
- **Infrastructure Engineering**
- **Embedded & Real-time Systems**

- [`Concurrency-Lib`](https://github.com/will51mps0n/Concurrency-Lib): Cooperative threading library with mutexes and condition variables (ucontext.h)
- [`MemoryManager-VM-OSPager`](https://github.com/will51mps0n/MemoryManager-VM-OSPager): Virtual memory pager with copy-on-write, file-backed memory, and clock-based eviction
- [`Assembler-and-Simulator`](https://github.com/will51mps0n/Assembler-and-Simulator): ISA simulator in C with full pipeline and assembler support
- [`Image-CNN`](https://github.com/will51mps0n/Image-CNN): CIFAR-10 classifier using PyTorch CNN and grid search
