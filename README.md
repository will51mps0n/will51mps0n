I'm a software engineer who recently graduated from the University of Michigan with a B.S. in Computer Science (Class of 2025). My work bridges real-world machine learning applications with deep technical fluency in systems and infrastructure.

- **AI/ML Projects:** Reinforcement learning, PyTorch CNNs, LSTM and tree-based models for forecasting, AlphaZero-style game agents
- **Data Science:** Feature engineering, EDA, regression/classification pipelines, time series modeling
- **Full-stack Tools:** Flask APIs, SQL, AWS integrations, iOS development (App Store deployed)
- **Systems Engineering:** C++ memory managers, threading libraries, file servers, cache simulators

I'm currently seeking roles where I can build intelligent systems—from modeling to deployment—and work with teams solving meaningful real-world problems.

## Featured Projects

### AI & ML Projects

- [`Othello-AG0`](https://github.com/will51mps0n/Othello-AG0): Reinforcement learning agent for Othello using Monte Carlo Tree Search and a deep neural network trained via self-play, inspired by AlphaZero.
- [`Image-CNN`](https://github.com/will51mps0n/Image-CNN): PyTorch-based CIFAR-10 classifier comparing fully connected networks and CNNs. Includes hyperparameter tuning and visualizations.
- [`Maze-Solver-AI`](https://github.com/will51mps0n/Maze-Solver-AI): Intelligent agent solving grid mazes using BFS, DFS, UCS, and A* with pathfinding visualizations in Matplotlib.

### Data Science & Forecasting

- [`Power-Outage-Analysis`](https://github.com/will51mps0n/Power-Outage-Analysis): Full ML pipeline for predicting power outage costs using Random Forests and engineered climate/economic features. Includes EDA and cost modeling.
- [`Stock-Prediction-Pipeline`](https://github.com/will51mps0n/Stock-Prediction-Pipeline): Time series forecasting pipeline using financial indicators and models like LSTM, Linear Regression, and Random Forest.

### App Store Project

- [**WaitFast (iOS App)**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waitfast/id6744225739): Real-time wait time tracker for restaurants and bars. Built with Swift frontend, Flask backend, AWS hosting, SQL database, and secure API integrations.

### Systems Projects

- [`Networked-Fs-Cpp`](https://github.com/will51mps0n/Networked-Fs-Cpp): C++ file server using Boost threads, TCP sockets, concurrency-safe I/O, and block-based file operations.
- [`Concurrency-Lib`](https://github.com/will51mps0n/Concurrency-Lib): Cooperative threading library using `ucontext.h` in C++. Implements thread scheduling, synchronization primitives, and voluntary context switches.
- [`MemoryManager-VM-OSPager`](https://github.com/will51mps0n/MemoryManager-VM-OSPager): Virtual memory pager for a simulated OS kernel. Supports swap/file-backed memory, page tables, and copy-on-write with a clock eviction policy.
