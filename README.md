# Hi! I'm Adam Simpson

I'm a C++ and systems programming enthusiast who recently graduated from Computer Science at the University of Michigan (Class of 2025). My work spans:

- Operating systems: paging, file systems, threading libraries
- Systems-level C++: concurrency, synchronization, TCP servers
- Machine learning: data pipelines, PyTorch models, search algorithms
- Full-stack projects: end-to-end MVPs, backend integrations

I'm currently most interested in roles and projects in:
- **Systems Software**
- **Kernel / OS Development**
- **Infrastructure Engineering**
- **Embedded & Real-time Systems**

## Featured Projects

Here are some of the most technically representative projects on my GitHub:

### Systems Projects

- [`Networked-Fs-Cpp`](https://github.com/will51mps0n/Networked-Fs-Cpp): Multithreaded file server in C++ using TCP sockets, safe directory traversal, concurrency-safe disk I/O, and block management.
- [`Concurrency-Lib`](https://github.com/will51mps0n/Concurrency-Lib): Cooperative threading library in C++ using `ucontext.h`, implementing thread creation, joining, yielding, mutexes, and condition variables.
- [`MemoryManager-VM-OSPager`](https://github.com/will51mps0n/MemoryManager-VM-OSPager): Virtual memory pager with swap-backed and file-backed memory, copy-on-write, clock-based page eviction, and per-process page tables.

### AI Projects

- [`Image-CNN`](https://github.com/will51mps0n/Image-CNN): CIFAR-10 classifier built in PyTorch. Trains and compares CNNs and fully connected models, with grid search and prediction visualization.
- [`Maze-Solver-AI`](https://github.com/will51mps0n/Maze-Solver-AI): AI agent using BFS, DFS, UCS, and A* to solve grid-based mazes with obstacles, costs, and visual path tracing.
- [`Othello-AG0`](https://github.com/will51mps0n/Othello-AG0): Reinforcement learning agent for Othello using Monte Carlo Tree Search and a self-play-trained neural network, inspired by AlphaZero.

### Data Science & ML Projects

- [`Power-Outage-Analysis`](https://github.com/will51mps0n/Power-Outage-Analysis): Full pipeline for modeling power outage costs using EDA, feature engineering, and regression with Scikit-learn and Plotly.
- [`Stock-Prediction-Pipeline`](https://github.com/will51mps0n/Stock-Prediction-Pipeline): Time series modeling using financial indicators, web-scraped data, and ML models including Random Forest, Linear Regression, and LSTM.

### App Store Project

- [**WaitFast (iOS App)**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waitfast/id6744225739): Crowd-powered restaurant wait time tracker with location filtering, historical data, and submission rewards. Built with a Flask + AWS backend and secure mobile integration.
