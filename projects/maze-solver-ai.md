# Maze Solver AI: Search Algorithms for Pathfinding  
[View Code on GitHub](https://github.com/will51mps0n/Maze-Solver-AI)

---

## Overview

The **Maze Solver AI** is an intelligent agent that efficiently navigates grid-based mazes using classic search algorithms, including **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**, and **A\* Search with Euclidean Heuristics**.  

The project focuses on both the algorithmic implementation and visualization of how the agent explores the maze, making it an educational tool for understanding AI pathfinding.

## Features:
- **Algorithm:**  
  Implemented modular classes for Nodes and AStarNodes to represent the search space, enabling smooth integration of multiple search strategies.

- **Search Techniques:**  
  Developed and tested four algorithms:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
  - A\* Search 

- **Visualization:**  
  Used **Matplotlib** to visualize:
  - Node expansion order
  - Final optimal path
  - Start, goal, and obstacle locations

## Problem & Solution

Maze pathfinding is a fundamental problem in AI and robotics, where finding the shortest and safest route is critical.  
The **Maze Solver AI** demonstrates how different search strategies balance efficiency, optimality, and resource usage, giving insight into:

- How uninformed vs. informed searches behave.
- Trade-offs between memory, speed, and path cost.
